## 🐘 YOLO Elephant Detection Overview
This project utilizes the YOLO object detection algorithm, known for its real-time performance and high accuracy. The model has been trained to specifically identify elephants in images by learning features such as shape, color, and texture from a labeled dataset.

Elephant detection can be used in wildlife conservation, research, and monitoring environments. This tool helps automate the process of identifying elephants in large image datasets, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency. The model can be fine-tuned with more data to improve accuracy across different terrains and lighting conditions.

# 🔍 How the Code Works
The script loads a pre-trained YOLO model with custom weights (best.pt).

It reads an input image from a specified path.

The YOLO model performs inference to detect elephants.

The output image, with bounding boxes drawn around detected elephants, is saved to the output directory.
